Profile Snapshot

Name: Παναγιώτης (Panagiotis) Chatzoglou

Location: Thessaloniki, Greece (open to Athens & international)

Role Focus: Data & AI Engineer • Software Engineer (full-stack → data)

Education: Electrical & Computer Engineering, AUTh (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki)

Current Role & Focus

Internship: IBM — Data & AI / Data Engineering (H1 progress)

What you’re doing now: Large-scale data workloads end-to-end (Oracle, BigQuery, Azure), including pipelines touching hundreds of terabytes; exposure to complex Oracle flows; scheduled shell scripts (cron) for ingestion/clean-up before core pipelines; growing emphasis on business context, stakeholder alignment, and clear technical documentation that other engineers can follow without hand-offs.

Career Positioning

Identity: Engineer who moves from code to clear problem framing, architecture, and business impact.

Edge: Strong SWE foundation + hands-on data engineering + communication with stakeholders → turns ambiguous asks into KPIs and shippable work.

Near-term goals (6–12 months):

Deepen ML fundamentals & algorithms; production ML on cloud data platforms.

Strengthen data modeling, observability, cost-aware design, and data contracts.

Keep writing lean, useful docs (runbooks, design notes, architecture overviews).

Projects & Experience Highlights

EurekAI (Founder, Full-Stack): AI-assisted study tool generating slides/notes from prompts. Stack: Next.js, Tailwind, Zustand, Clerk, Neon/Postgres, Docker, OpenAI APIs. MVP built rapidly; iterative roadmap.

Freelance Full-Stack: Apps for local businesses. TypeScript, React/Next.js, Node/Express, MongoDB/MySQL. REST APIs, UML/ER, SEO, performance, Docker + CI/CD.

Skolaris (University project): Modular e-learning platform; requirements, system design, REST architecture.

Hackathons/Workshops: Low/No-code DSL for Cyber-Physical Systems; environment modelling and validation; broadened perspective on tooling and pipelines.

EESTEC (Volunteer): Web maintenance; teamwork, cross-functional comms.

Technical Stack (operational)

Languages: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Bash, Dart

Data & Platforms: Oracle, BigQuery, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB

Cloud: Azure (AZ-900 certified), AWS (S3/SES basics), Firebase; learning GCP patterns via BigQuery work

Data Engineering: SQL (Oracle focus), partitioning/batching basics at scale, scheduled cron jobs, ingestion/cleaning before main pipelines

ML/AI: OpenAI APIs; IBM AI Developer specialization; strengthening core ML & algorithms

Backend: Node.js, Express, Flask, FastAPI, Spring Boot (intro)

Frontend: React, Next.js, Tailwind, ShadCN, Material UI

DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes (intro), GitHub Actions CI/CD, Linux, Bash, Ansible

Testing: Jest, Cypress, Vitest

Design & Docs: UML, ER models, SRS, concise runbooks and design notes

Certifications & Learning

Microsoft AZ-900: Azure Fundamentals

IBM AI Developer (Coursera)

Meta Front-End Developer (Coursera)

Software Design & Architecture Specialization

The Ultimate React Course 2024 (Udemy)

Data eng. courses: Data Engineering, Data Warehouse, SQL, deep dive Oracle SQL (many; certs kept updated on LinkedIn)

Key Book: Fundamentals of Data Engineering — shaped your end-to-end, lifecycle view (generation → ingestion → storage → transform → serving; choose designs for speed, cost, reliability; think beyond tool hype).

Communication & Working Style

Stakeholder-first: Start with the business question, co-define KPIs and scope, then design the simplest path that moves a decision.

Documentation: Write it so others can run and extend without a meeting (design doc + runbook + brief rationale).

Tone: Humble, practical, outcome-oriented; avoids hype; comfortable in Greek or English.

Content/Brand: Posts and comments that are thoughtful, concise, and invite discussion; avoids over-claiming.

Companies & Networking

Warm contacts: Intracom, Netcompany, Pfizer (career fair interest; asked to message when applying).

Preference: Summer internship in Thessaloniki originally; open to Athens and beyond post-studies.

Outreach style: Personalized Greek messages; thanks + specific next steps; asks targeted for guidance or referrals.

Quick Answers your Agent can give

“What do you work on at IBM?”
Large data workloads end-to-end on Oracle, BigQuery, and Azure, with scheduled shell scripts handling initial cleaning before core pipelines; focus on translating stakeholder needs into reliable, cost-aware data products and writing clear docs for hand-off.

“What’s your strongest skill?”
Turning vague requests into precise, testable specs and data products, backed by solid SWE fundamentals and clear, shareable documentation.

“What tech are you best with?”
SQL and data platforms (Oracle, BigQuery), full-stack web (TypeScript, React/Next.js, Node), cloud basics on Azure, and practical DevOps (Docker, Linux, CI).

“What are you learning next?”
Core ML and algorithms, production ML on cloud data platforms, better observability and data contracts, and cost-aware design.

“What’s your philosophy on data work?”
Start from the business outcome, design for speed, cost, and trust, and document decisions so value survives beyond the author.
